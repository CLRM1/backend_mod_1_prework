## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  - I currently view learning as a process, have a growth mindset and try to take care of my brain.
  - Moving forward I want to teach what Iâ€™m learning and take more short breaks.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
- I would use either
```ruby
puts "Hello World!"
```
- Or
```ruby
print "Hello World!"
```

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
- The octothorpe `#`.  

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

  - An integer is a whole number while a float contains a decimal, for example 12.0 or 12.2 are both floats.
12 and 1 are both integers.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```ruby
puts animal
```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
- Interpolation is where your embed ruby code into a string.
- For example, in ruby:
```ruby
puts "The #{animal} looks like a striped horse."
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
- The gets method is used to get input from a user in ruby:

```ruby
gets
```

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

- The `chomps` method removes the next line that is automatically added when you get user input using `gets`.
- The `length` method returns the number of characters in a string.
