# Declare two variables - hero_name AND special_ability - set to strings
hero_name = "Superman"
special_ability = "Fly"

# Declare two variables - greeting AND catchphrase
#   greeting should be assigned to a string that uses interpolation to include the hero_name
greeting = "Hello, I am #{hero_name}!"
#   catchphrase should be assigned to a string that uses interpolation to include the special_ability
catchphrase = "My special ability is the ability to #{special_ability}"
# Declare two variables - power AND energy - set to integers
power = 20
energy = 40
# Declare two variables - full_power AND full_energy
#   full_power should multiply your current power by 500
full_power = power * 500
#   full_energy should add 150 to your current energy
full_energy = energy + 150
# Declare two variables - is_human and identity_concealed - assigned to booleans
is_human = false
identity_concealed = true

# Declare two variables - arch_enemies AND sidekicks
#   arch_enemies should be an array of at least 3 different enemy strings
arch_enemy = ["luther", "joker", "hawkeye", "robin"]
#   sidekicks should be an array of at least 3 different sidekick strings
sidekicks = ["batman", "wonder woman", "flash", "sonic"]
# Print the first sidekick to your terminal
puts sidekicks[0]
# Print the last arch_enemy to the terminal
puts arch_enemy[3]
# Write some code to add a new arch_enemy to the arch_enemies array
arch_enemy.push("tails")
# Print the arch_enemies array to terminal to ensure you added a new arch_enemey
puts arch_enemy
# Remove the first sidekick from the sidekicks array
sidekicks.delete_at(0)
# Print the sidekicks array to terminal to ensure you added a new sidekick
puts sidekicks
# Create a method called assess_situation that takes three arguments - danger_level, save_the_day, bad_excuse
#   - danger_level should be an integer
#   - save_the_day should be a string a hero would say once they save the day
#   - bad_excuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the danger_level
def assess_situation(danger_level, save_the_day, bad_excuse)
  if danger_level > 50
    puts bad_excuse
  elsif danger_level >= 10 && danger_level <= 50
    puts save_the_day
  else
    puts "Meh. Hard pass."
  end
end


# Your method should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
#   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the bad_excuse to the terminal
#   - Anything danger_level that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the save_the_day string to the terminal
#   - If the danger_level is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the terminal.

#Test Cases
announcement = 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!'
excuse = 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.'
# assess_situation(99, announcement, excuse) > Should print - 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.'
assess_situation(99, announcement, excuse)
#assess_situation(21, announcement, excuse) > should print - 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!'
assess_situation(21, announcement, excuse)
#assess_situation(3, announcement, excuse) > should print - "Meh. Hard pass."
assess_situation(3, announcement, excuse)
# Declare a new variable - scary_monster - assigned to an hash with the following key/values
#   - name (string)
#   - smell (string)
#   - weight (integer)
#   - citiesDestroyed (array)
#   - luckyNumbers (array)
#   - address (hash with following key/values: number , street , state, zip)

# - Create the following class methods
#   - say_name, should print the hero's name to the terminal
#   - maximize_energy, should update the energy_level to 1000
#   - gain_power, should take an argument of a number and INCREASE the power_level by that number

# - Create 2 instances of your SuperHero class
